      <description>During 22-25 Sep 2018 I attended the NumFOCUS Summit. It consisted of two 2-day parts: the Sustainability Workshop (attended by 1-3 maintainers of almost all sponsored projects), and the Project Forum (attended by a subset of those maintainers plus a number of key industry stakeholders). I attended wearing two hats: as a member of the NumFOCUS Board of Directors, and as a maintainer of NumPy. Besides me, NumPy was represented by Allan Haldane, whom I had the pleasure to meet in person for the first time.</description>
